<h1>The Corporate UI Starter Kit</h1>
<p>Developing a solution split into Web Components rather than one big hunch of code slightly differs from traditional development. In this folder we've added some files that will help you understand both how to use web components in the Corporate UI and also how to develop your own.</p>
<p>Usually, we want to keep documentation to a minimum and keep the files well commented. If you'll open index.html in this folder, you'll have the chance to learn a lot about what the different components and file inclusions will do for you. The files in this folder are write protected so please make a copy of the folder and move it outside your GitHub clone.</p> 
<h2>hello-world</h2>
<p>The Hello World component is provided both in an one page version as well in a version that's isolated in a component file of its own. Experiment either in the <b>hello-world-one-pager.html</b> file or in the <b>hello-world.html</b>. If you are making changes in the later, you'll run that component by opening the <b>demo-page.html</b> where it is included.</p>
<h2>new-component</h2>
<p><b>index.html</b> <a href="https://static.scania.com/ux-library/template/starter-kit/" target="_blank">(looks like this)</a> represents one of the files in you future solution. The <b>new-component.html</b> file could represent a part of your solution and basically it could be hosted anywhere on the web. If it shows to be a component that others find interest in, it will be very easy to make it availble for them to use.</p>
<p>The component is already imported to index.html so you can start by modifying the component itself. Try different type of modifications like for example altering the image size and font size. You can also try to add an extra attribute so one can include a button with a link when using the element.</p>
<p>Feel free to experiment.</p>
<h2>easter-egg</h2>
<p>The Easter Egg component is provided so that you can test an environment and make sure it can handle Google Polymer and includes from static.scania.com. When you run this component, hit F7 to display an Easter Egg message. </p>
