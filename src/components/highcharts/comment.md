`c-highcharts` Spline charts integrate all the characteristics of a conventional line chart except for the fact that unlike line charts, which connect data points with straight lines, spline charts draw a fitted curved line to join the data points.

Spline charts can be used for plotting data that requires the usage of curve-fitting e.g. an impulse-response chart, a product life cycle chart, etc. It is also significantly used in designing Pareto charts.
